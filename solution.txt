Explanations: To provide clarity and context for future developers or yourself.
Debugging: To temporarily disable or mark specific sections of code for troubleshooting.
Placeholders: To reserve space for future content or code.
Copyright Notices: To include copyright information or licensing terms.

<html>
<head>
    <title>HTML Comments Example</title>

Q4.

Ans: <!-- Write a short note on Tag and element with an example 

Ans : Tags are the building blocks of HTML elements. They are enclosed in angle brackets (<>).

Opening tag: Starts with < and ends with >.
Closing tag: Starts with </ and ends with >.
Elements are formed by combining opening and closing tags, along with the content within them. 
They define the structure and content of an HTML page. -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Sample Page</h1>
</body>
</html>

In this example:

<!-- <h1> and </h1> are the opening and closing tags, respectively.
The text "This is a heading" is the content.
Together, they form an h1 element, which defines a level-one heading. -->

Q5

Ans: <!-- What is the DOCTYPE Declaration in HTML?

Ans: A DOCTYPE declaration is an instruction to the web browser about the type of document it is going to parse. It's essential for browsers to render web pages correctly.   

Standardization: It ensures that browsers interpret the HTML code according to specific standards.   
Rendering Mode: It determines the rendering mode (standards mode or quirks mode) used by the browser, influencing how elements are displayed.   
Feature Support: It helps browsers identify which HTML features and elements are supported.   
Common DOCTYPE Declaration for HTML5: -->

<!DOCTYPE html>

<!-- Key Points to Remember: -->

<!-- It must be the very first line in your HTML document.   
It is case-insensitive.
It is not an HTML tag, but a declaration.   
For different HTML versions, the DOCTYPE declaration might vary.   
By including the correct DOCTYPE declaration, you ensure that your web pages are displayed consistently across different browsers and devices. -->

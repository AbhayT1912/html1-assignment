<!-- What is the DOCTYPE Declaration in HTML?

Ans: A DOCTYPE declaration is an instruction to the web browser about the type of document it is going to parse. It's essential for browsers to render web pages correctly.   

Standardization: It ensures that browsers interpret the HTML code according to specific standards.   
Rendering Mode: It determines the rendering mode (standards mode or quirks mode) used by the browser, influencing how elements are displayed.   
Feature Support: It helps browsers identify which HTML features and elements are supported.   
Common DOCTYPE Declaration for HTML5: -->

<!DOCTYPE html>

<!-- Key Points to Remember: -->

<!-- It must be the very first line in your HTML document.   
It is case-insensitive.
It is not an HTML tag, but a declaration.   
For different HTML versions, the DOCTYPE declaration might vary.   
By including the correct DOCTYPE declaration, you ensure that your web pages are displayed consistently across different browsers and devices. -->

<!-- Write a short note on Tag and element with an example 

Ans : Tags are the building blocks of HTML elements. They are enclosed in angle brackets (<>).

Opening tag: Starts with < and ends with >.
Closing tag: Starts with </ and ends with >.
Elements are formed by combining opening and closing tags, along with the content within them. 
They define the structure and content of an HTML page. -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Sample Page</h1>
</body>
</html>

In this example:

<!-- <h1> and </h1> are the opening and closing tags, respectively.
The text "This is a heading" is the content.
Together, they form an h1 element, which defines a level-one heading. -->
